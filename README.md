# OS3M-firmware-spoofork
This spoofing fork of the OS3M-firmware implements the HID descriptors and reporting that jfedor2 used in his [spaceball-2003 repo](https://github.com/jfedor2/spaceball-2003)

First install the 3Dconnexion drivers, and then this firmware should show up as a spacemouse

# Build
This fork builds and flashes with platformio.
With a working install of platformio, `pio run -t upload` should build and upload the firmware assuming the OS3M mouse is in DFU

This repository houses the firmware for the OS3M mouse project. It is developed using VS Code with the STM32 for VS Code plugin. The original project template was generated by STM32CubeMX, and the .ioc file is available for you to freely modify!
